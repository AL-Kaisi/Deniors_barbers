1. **Copy Recent Reviews**: Go to your Google Business dashboard
2. **Update the JavaScript**: Edit `/js/google-reviews.js`
3. **Find the function**: `getCuratedDeNirosReviews()`
4. **Replace sample reviews** with real ones like this:

```javascript
{
    author_name: "Real Customer Name",
    rating: 5,
    text: "Copy the actual review text from Google Business",
    time: "1 week ago",
    profile_photo_url: "https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=Real+Customer+Name&background=c59d5f&color=fff&size=40"
}
```

### **Method 2: Live Google API Integration (Future)**
For automatic live reviews, you'll need:

1. **Google Places API Key**
